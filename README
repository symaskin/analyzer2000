My logfile analyzer-project

* NOTE: This is not meant to be (not now atleast) a serious project. It is mainly for me learning
Python and GIT. Expect the worst.

just started with Python, haven't got any prior programming experience.. So instead of fucking around with textbook examples
i started this.

future plans:

* generate static html
* search function
* build some sort of gallery
* statistics
